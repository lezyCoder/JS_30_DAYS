 Operators are symbol which tells the compiler to which type of operation we have to perform.

 Great start! Let's expand on the different types of operators in JavaScript:

1. **Assignment Operator (`=`):**
   - Used to assign values to variables.
   - Example: `let x = 10;`

2. **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `%`, `/`):**
   - Used to perform mathematical operations.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let sum = 5 + 3; // Addition
     let difference = 5 - 3; // Subtraction
     let product = 5 * 3; // Multiplication
     let quotient = 5 / 3; // Division
     let remainder = 5 % 3; // Modulus
     ```

3. **Comparison Operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`):**
   - Used to compare two values.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let isLess = 5 < 10; // Less than
     let isGreater = 5 > 3; // Greater than
     let isEqual = 5 == '5'; // Equal to (loose equality)
     let isStrictEqual = 5 === 5; // Strict equal to
     let isNotEqual = 5 != '5'; // Not equal to (loose inequality)
     let isStrictNotEqual = 5 !== '5'; // Strict not equal to
     ```

4. **Logical Operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`):**
   - Used to perform logical operations.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let andOperator = true && false; // Logical AND
     let orOperator = true || false; // Logical OR
     let notOperator = !true; // Logical NOT
     ```

5. **Relational Operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`):**
   - These are actually part of the comparison operators and are used to compare two values.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let isLessOrEqual = 5 <= 10; // Less than or equal to
     let isGreaterOrEqual = 5 >= 3; // Greater than or equal to
     ```

6. **Bitwise Operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`):**
   - Used to perform bit-level operations on binary numbers.
   - Examples:
     ```javascript
     let andBitwise = 5 & 1; // Bitwise AND
     let orBitwise = 5 | 1; // Bitwise OR
     let xorBitwise = 5 ^ 1; // Bitwise XOR
     let notBitwise = ~5; // Bitwise NOT
     let leftShift = 5 << 1; // Left shift
     let rightShift = 5 >> 1; // Right shift
     let unsignedRightShift = 5 >>> 1; // Unsigned right shift
     ```

These operators are fundamental to performing various operations in JavaScript. ðŸ˜Š
