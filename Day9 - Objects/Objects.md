In JavaScript, objects are like Swiss Army knives‚Äîthey can hold various properties and even wield powerful methods. Buckle up, because we're diving into the world of object methods!

## 1. `Object.assign(target, source)`

- **Purpose**: Copies properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Merging objects: Combine properties from different objects into a single object.
  - Cloning objects: Create a new object with the same properties as an existing one.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const person1 = { firstName: "John", age: 30 };
  const person2 = { lastName: "Doe" };
  const mergedPerson = Object.assign({}, person1, person2);
  // Result: { firstName: "John", age: 30, lastName: "Doe" }
  ```

## 2. `Object.entries(object)`

- **Purpose**: Returns an array of key/value pairs from an object.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Iterating over object properties.
  - Converting objects to maps.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
  const entries = Object.entries(person);
  // Result: [["name", "Alice"], ["age", 25]]
  ```

## 3. `Object.fromEntries(iterable)`

- **Purpose**: Creates an object from an array of key/value pairs.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Reversing the process of `Object.entries()`.
  - Building objects from dynamic data (e.g., form input).
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const keyValuePairs = [["fruit", "apple"], ["color", "red"]];
  const fruitObject = Object.fromEntries(keyValuePairs);
  // Result: { fruit: "apple", color: "red" }
  ```

## 4. `Object.keys(object)`

- **Purpose**: Returns an array of an object's keys (property names).
- **Use Cases**:
  - Checking if a specific property exists.
  - Looping through object keys.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const car = { make: "Toyota", model: "Camry" };
  const keys = Object.keys(car);
  // Result: ["make", "model"]
  ```

## 5. `Object.values(object)`

- **Purpose**: Returns an array of an object's property values.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Extracting values for further processing.
  - Filtering or mapping object values.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const scores = { math: 90, science: 85, history: 78 };
  const values = Object.values(scores);
  // Result: [90, 85, 78]
  ```

Remember, these methods are like secret tools in your JavaScript toolbox. Use them wisely, and may your code be as organized as a well-arranged spice rack! üå∂Ô∏èüîß
